# @cto.af/ca

Testing-only Certificate Authority (CA) for your local development environment
ONLY.  This is in no way suitable for production of any kind.

This package will automatically create new keypairs as needed, with the CA
cert lasting a year by default and the leaf certs 3 days by default.

Currently, there is NO SECURITY for the private keys.  These should be stored
in an OS-specific keychain one day.

## Installation

```sh
npm install @cto.af/ca
```

## API

Full [API documentation](http://cto-af.github.io/ca/) is available.

Example:

```js
import {createCert} from '@cto.af/ca';
import {createServer} from 'node:tls';

// This reads and writes files from a user-scoped config directory for
// the CA cert and cwd()/.cert for the certificate.
const {key, cert} = await createCert({
  host: 'foo.local', // Default: 'localhost'
});
const server = createServer({key, cert}, () => ...);
```
